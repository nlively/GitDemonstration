      <h3>Mobile Time Clock Technology</h3>
      <p>Telephony and timecards are a thing of the past. Employees use <br/>Boomr to check-in and out of appointments on their smart-phone or <br/>any mobile device/tablet. These time stamps are geotagged to verify <br/>employees are at the point of care. This allows for real-time accountability, <br/>and proactive patient care delivery.</p></div>

      <h3>Real-time Data Collection</h3>
      <p>Our mobile app was designed to make it easy for employees to collect and submit patient care data in real time. Simple checklists are available to the employee to click what they are observing or doing. Photos can also be safely and securely uploaded to provide visual transparency of what has happened during the shift. All of this data is time stamped, creating a care timeline for the Agency to review, effectively replacing manual documentation and laborious narratives.</p></div>

      <h3>Clinical Tools & Alerts</h3>

      Boomr allows Agencies to customize the lists of data that show up in the mobile App into the following categories:<br/> <br/>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily Activities</strong> - a list of tasks that employees will work on while at
          the clients home</li><br/>

        <li><strong>Client Status</strong> - general notes about the physical, mental and
          emotional condition of the client</li><br/>

        <li><strong>Observations</strong> - specific measurements or assessments relating to
          the unique health and medical condition of the client</li><br/>
      </ul>

      The collection of personalized data allows for custom alerts to be set in order to notify the Agency when information that has been submitted indicates a patient is at high-risk or in need of additional support. This oversight encourages closer Employee-Client interaction and reduces the frequency of hospital admissions and visits to the physician.
