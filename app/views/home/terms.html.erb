      In connection with the Service and the Website, we collect user submitted   personally identifying information and other information, including but not   limited to:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>Information you provide to        us on forms that you enter on the Website or that you provide to us in        writing. </li>
      <li>Information you provide        when you make a financial transaction on the Website.</li>

      <li>Information from third        parties, including verification services, payment processing services,        and other online and offline sources. For example, this would include        insurance and clinical information as well as information we receive        from a third-party background check service in response to a user        requesting a background check on themselves. It would also include        updated address or contact information that we might use to correct our        records so that we can communicate with you more easily. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The information we collect may include: first   name, last name, date of birth, city, state, address, ZIP code, phone, email   address and other information specific to the service requested or provided.

We   may also collect a Care Giver&rsquo;s professional license number and expiration   date, date of birth, gender, clinical certifications, information about   physical and clinical limitations, resume, company name (if applicable), and   ZIP codes served. If you request a background check on yourself we may   collect your Social Security Number.

If you request an insurance   verification we may collect your policy number, policy limits and other   information about your policy, a copy of your policy card.<br />
      We may also collect information about third-party   references from Care Givers. This information may include the name, phone   number, and email address of the third-party reference. This information is   collected when a Care Giver creates or updates their profile. This   information is collected so that a Care Seeker or Boomr acting on behalf of a   Care Seeker can contact the third-party reference to verify information   provided by the Care Provider. Third party references may have their   information removed from the Website at any time.<br />
      We use the information we obtain to develop and   deliver the Service and to fulfill legal requirements. We limit the   collection and use of customer information to the minimum we require to   deliver the Service to our customers and to administer our business.<br />

      <li>We may disclose personal        information about you to third parties when we believe such disclosure        is appropriate to comply with a legal requirement, such as a law,        regulation, court order, subpoena or search warrant, or in the course of        a legal proceeding.
